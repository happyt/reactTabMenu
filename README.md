## reactTabMenu

This is just a small project to play around with React.

- Initially just adding some tabs

- Haven't used Bootstrap, using the Pure css library
- Over-ride some of the colours
- Tried a few icon font methods
    - boostrap (took this out - too big)
    - icomoon
    - https://dmfrancisco.github.io/react-icons/
    - fontawesome

- List from http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users - json array
- Added Firebase ToDo example , needs permission
- My updates from firebase, will amend to look like snap list
- Separate sliders page
- Add buttons page
